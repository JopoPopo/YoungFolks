The dashboard.py and apis.py files combine to create a simple Streamlit-powered web application
which serves to display statistical information and data regarding water quality as well as a section
dedicated to displaying the possibilities that NASA's APOD API offers. It showcases basic Streamlit
functionality and API integration and provides a smooth UI design for users to analyze data and
discover astronomy. Along with these files are a few other files which further utilize Streamlit to
implement different features such as LLM integration.
